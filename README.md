# Dental Project – Technical Contribution Record

This repository documents the original technical development of a system for automated orthodontic root parallelism assessment using deep learning and computer vision.

While the general idea of measuring root angles has been previously discussed in the clinical field, the **specific technical realization** — including the system architecture, algorithmic approach, model design, segmentation refinement, axis computation, and integration of geometric and deep learning methods — was entirely conceived and implemented by **Minoo Ahmadi**.

This repository serves as a **time-stamped record of technical inventorship**, establishing independent authorship of the engineering and computational framework behind the system.

All code, design decisions, and implementations herein are original contributions. Unauthorized use or patenting of this work without proper attribution will be considered a misappropriation of intellectual property.
